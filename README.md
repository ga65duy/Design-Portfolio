### Crafty Burger

Crafty Burger is an ordering system for burgers, which can be used on monitors in the restaurants, 
but also on mobile phones to make orders on the way to the restaurants. 
The customers can preview their own individual burger and can filter the ingredients according to their food preferences. 

There is also a kitchen view for the employees of the restaurant.
They just need to login to start their shift and click next when a burger is completed. 
They can also see which ingredients are out of stock. So that the responsible employee can refill them.
